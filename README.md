## Design

### Colors
I chose the colors of the Lebanese flag as I thought this would compliment a Lebanese food blog which should be bright and colorful.

  - A blog page where recipes for different Lebanese dishes can be found. Registered users can also create, edit, and delete their recipes.

#### Database

- When creating the database structure schema for this project, I made use of the [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/) website. This online tool provided me with a visual platform to create and document the database schema, streamlining the planning and implementation process for the blog application's database.
